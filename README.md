# Q1Project

DjKg is in the house! DjKg was created for new DJ’s who want to try their own music out on the turn table. Experienced DJ’s prefer more complex functionality to the turn tables as well as the most popular songs. What about the causal DJ who just wants to mix music for him or herself? I believe the biggest problems with DJ websites is the fact you can only play their top 50 songs. Personally I don't often listen to top 50 playlists, instead I prefer Classic Rock and House music. DjKg allows you to quickly listen to some of my favorite songs as well as search all of Spotify for a preview of any song. This works better for someone who doesn’t want to spend months learning the intricacies of all the equipment DJ’s use. DjKg allows you to get on the website and start mixing immediately, then if you want to search Spotify for your favorites and mix them the power is in your hands!
